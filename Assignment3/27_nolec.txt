dont edit the existing decks in json. edit only newly added deck names and content.

maybe use diff. json for new cards?

list<map> translate to db - json file

2 step process - take data, convert to model object, then translate to json

take card data, move to sql queries for persistence and then connect to json - will make things easy for deck loading

sqflite - doesnt work for windows. use sqflite (some other)
